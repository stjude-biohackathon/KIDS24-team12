  },
  {
    "instruction": "Can you explain how the DRAGEN mapper handles seed matching and frequency limits?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The DRAGEN mapper matches a seed to multiple places in the reference genome and retrieves those matches from a hash table. However, it has a limit on the number of matches, or frequency, of each seed. If the seed frequency exceeds the limit, the software extends the seed to a longer secondary seed or, if that's not possible, rejects the seed and stores a single High Frequency record."

    "input": "",
    "output": "The DRAGEN seed frequency limit is a parameter that determines when seeds are rejected during mapping due to high frequency. The default limit is 16, and it has a minimal impact on mapping quality due to two reasons: rejected seeds are often extremely high-frequency and not useful for mapping, and there are usually other seed positions to check in a given read."

    "input": "",
    "output": "A target seed frequency can be specified with the `--ht-target-seed-freq` option. This target frequency is used when generating seed extensions for high frequency primary seeds, with a preference towards extended seed frequencies near the target."

    "input": "",
    "output": "The default value of 4 for `--ht-target-seed-freq` means that the software is biased towards generating shorter seed extensions than necessary to map seeds uniquely."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Can you tell me about masked references in the DRAGEN software package?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Masked references in DRAGEN is a feature that allows for strategic masking of native reference ALT contigs to increase accuracy. This is done by specifying regions in a BED file to be masked with N's, which affects the creation of the mapper hash table."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Briefly, how do I specify regions to be masked in DRAGEN?",
    "input": "",

    "input": "",
    "output": "The DRAGEN software package is a bioinformatics tool used for processing and analyzing high-throughput sequencing data.\n\nSummary: The passage discusses two new features in the DRAGEN software package - automatic masking and handling of decoy contigs. Automatic masking applies a corresponding bed file for detected references when running from a fasta file. In handling decoy contigs, the hash table builder automatically adds decoy contigs from a default file to the FASTA file prior to building the hash table. This improves the accuracy of variant calling but may result in a lower mapping rate."
